## The Actuarial Approach to Life Expectancy

The study of Life Expectancy is integral to many concepts in the world of Actuarial Science. Products such as Life Insurance, Pensions and Annuities all deal with "Life Contingent" cash flows, so predicting the mortality of purchasers of these products is essential to price them correctly.

Government agencies such as the CDC and Stats Canada also produce mortality studies, and as a result there are a number of publically available Life Tables similar to what a Life Actuary might use at work. This app makes these tables easily accessable for general use and provides a layperson's guide to basic actuarial notation.
