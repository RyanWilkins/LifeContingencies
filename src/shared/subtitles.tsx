        You might not know the notation, but you're likely familiar with this first concept. In Actuarial Science, the symbol eÌŠ<sub>x</sub> denotes
        the "Average number of years until death for a person aged x". A Life Table can be divided by variables such as gender, country and smoking status.
        The dashboard below pulls from government agency Life Tables and will update the chart based on your input.

        Your age
        tells an Actuary one key piece of information - you survived at least from birth until today! All else equal, an Actuary will give a lower chance of surviving
        to age 90 to a person who is currently 50 than a person who is currently 80, as the 50 year old first has to survive ages 50 - 80. 
        Actuaries denote <sub>n</sub>p<sub>x</sub> as the probability of a person currently aged x of living at least n more years.

        If you were to die tomorrow, an Actuary could make a decent guess as to what happened just based on your age and gender. If you're young, it's more 
        likely that some external force such as an accident happened. As we age, heart disease and cancer become more prominent. Try changing around the 
        inputs below and see what trends you find.
